# DataVis_Group5_Project1
This repo is for DataVis Group 5 project work 

Mohamed Abdi: Took the total crime data in Minneapolis from 2017-2018. Cleaned up the data and organized it by neighborhood. Then I took a sum of all the crime in each neighborhood and made a dataframe. Converted that dataframe into a csv file and used that data to plot a map of Minneapolis and layer a heat map of crime over Minneapolis.
