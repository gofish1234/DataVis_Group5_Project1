# DataVis_Group5_Project1
This repo is for DataVis Group 5 project work 

Mohamed Abdi: Took the total crime data in Minneapolis from 2017-2018. Cleaned up the data and organized it by neighborhood. Then I took a sum of all the crime in each neighborhood and made a dataframe. Converted that dataframe into a csv file and used that data to plot a map of Minneapolis and layer a heat map of crime over Minneapolis.

Chris Miller:  I combined the cities that the major scooter companies have operations, made an API call to get lat/lngs, which were converted to lists and visualized via jupyter gmaps.  I used seaborn to produce the boxplot summarizing mean crime rate for each type for the periods before the trial and during the trial.   I then used numpy to do a ttest on each crime category before and after to determine which changes were significant.
